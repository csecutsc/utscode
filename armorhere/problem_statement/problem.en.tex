\problemname{Get Yer Armor Here}

Torbjörn, a small dwarf who excels in creating armor packs from Scrap Metal, is surveying a map representing a
battlefield. He’s been airdropped into the middle of this battlefield, which is represented by a rectangular N x M 2D
matrix. \\

Torbjörn, a small dwarf who excels in creating armor packs from Scrap Metal, is surveying a map representing a
battlefield. He’s been airdropped into the middle of this battlefield, which is represented by a rectangular N x M
2D matrix. \\

On each turn, Torbjörn will collect the scrap metal available on the square that he is currently on, and then move
either one square up, down, left, or right, choosing the square that has the most available scrap metal. If there is no
more scrap metal available in any adjacent squares, Torbjörn will request an extraction and call the mission complete.
You may assume that Torbjörn will never be forced to choose between adjacent squares with the same number of scrap
metal. \\

Write a program that given input as the field matrix, returns the maximum number of scrap metal that the Torbjörn
collect from the battlefield. You may assume that the matrix is rectangular with at least 1 row and 1 column, and it is
populated with non-negative integers. \\

\section*{Input}
You will be given $1 \leq N,M \leq 5000$, followed by $N$ lines, each containing $M$  non-negative integers.
\section*{Output}
Output the longest campaign that Trahearne’s army will have to endure to face Mordremoth. \\
