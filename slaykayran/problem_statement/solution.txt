We can solve this using 2D Dynamic programming, where at each state we hold the minimum sequence required to
get the kayran to 0 heads, considering it has a certain number of heads, and your current health;
DP[num_heads][cur_health]. We initially assume that each sub problem is possible, but it requires an undetermined
amount of moves. Now when we solve each sub problem, we determine the hero's and kayrne's hp and head count after
defending and attacking, and base our sub problem's solution on the solution for these two sub problem. In the case
that it's impossible to solve this sub problem, we update our DP array to indicate that this sub problem
was computed but was determined to be impossible.
