\problemname{Melzar's Maze}

Being an aspiring young adventurer, you seek to join the Champion’s Guild. However, the Guildmaster doesn’t seem to be
all that impressed with your abilities. He gives you a challenge, slay Melzar the Mad, a wizard driven to crazed
madness that imprisoned himself in his labyrinth of a basement. \\

You are discouraged by the challenge – everyone knows that Melzar’s maze-like basement is filled with various demons,
spirits, and beasts. You decide to visit the resident Gypsy, who, after a small payment of one million gold coins, uses
her omniscient powers to grant you a map of Melzar’s Maze. She also estimates the strengths of the monsters at each
given room, and hands you back an annotated map represented by a rectangular N x M 2D matrix. \\

You are filled with determination once realize that you will always begin at the top-left corner of Melzar’s Maze, and
Melzar will always be located at the bottom-right corner. You can get a tactical advantage if you find the most optimal
path to Melzar! As with any adventurer, you will die if your HP reaches 0. Some of the rooms are guarded by enemies –
you will lose health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic
orbs that increase your health (positive integers). To not waste any time, you only ever move to the Right,
or Downwards. \\

Before you attempt to enter Melzar’s Maze, you decide it wise to train your HP stat so that you may vanquish Melzar.
But, being lazy, you don’t want to over-train. Find the minimum HP that you require to be able to reach and defeat
Melzar the Mad.
